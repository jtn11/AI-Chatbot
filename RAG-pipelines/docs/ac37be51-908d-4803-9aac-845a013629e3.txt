PROJECTS 
TailorAI – Resume Analysis Platform | GitHubDec 2025 - Jan 2026 Next.js, Node.js, Firebase (Firestore), LLM API, JSON Workflows ● Architected an AI-powered analysis engine using Next.js and LLM APIs to evaluate resumes against job descriptions with a focus on 
structured
 
JSON
 
output
.
 
 ● Developed a full-stack system featuring persistent analysis history and real-time UI updates, utilizing Firebase Firestore for scalable data 
management.
 
 ● Optimized prompt-driven workflows to identify critical keyword gaps and generate match scores, improving the accuracy of improvement 
suggestions
 
for
 
users.
 
 
AI-Powered Speech Translator | GitHubOct 2025 - Nov 2025React.js, TypeScript, Groq’s Whisper API, MediaRecorder API, State Management ● Engineered a real-time speech translation application leveraging Groq’s Whisper API to transcribe and translate Hindi audio to English text. ● Implemented robust asynchronous API handling using FormData and the MediaRecorder API to capture high-quality audio streams. ● Designed comprehensive state management and error-handling protocols for microphone access and API failures to ensure a seamless user 
experience.
 
TaskNest – Collaborative Task Management Platform | GitHubSept 2025- Oct 2025 Next.js, React.js, TypeScript , Node.js , Express.js Firebase (Auth/Firestore) ● Built a collaborative productivity platform using Next.js and TypeScript , enabling real-time task synchronization across multiple user 
workspaces.
 ● Integrated a secure authentication system and Firebase Firestore backend to manage complex data relations and scalable user 
assignments.
